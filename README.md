## Setup

* Install all the needed dependencies, I run `yarn`, but `npm install` will also do the same thing.
* Run the local Node Server, I use `yarn start`, but `npm start` will also do the same thing.
* Run a local server to serve html files, I use `python3 -m http.server 5000`, you can use anything, just don't use PORT `3000`, it's already used by Node Server, or change the PORT in Node Server.
